                        Hello! My name is Matthew Schroeter and I am a 5th year student at Northeastern University majoring in Bioengineering and graduating in May 2022. Through working in a bio-inspired robotics lab at Northeastern, I've become fascinated with the field of robotics and mechanical design. 
			In the lab I have gained extensive experience in electro-mechanical design and have been exposed to a variety of rapid prototyping techniques.
                    </p>
		    <p>
			
		    </p>
		    <p>
			My other passion is space, which I discovered by joining a club called Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) at Northeastern. Here I've had the amazing opportunity to work on multiple NASA design competitions in a team setting. These projects have given me a lot of experience in breaking down complex problems through research and in making design decisions. 
			In the future I hope to learn more about designing electro-mechanical systems and controls in the context of space robotics and vehicles.

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The 2022 BIG Idea Challenge called for the development of rovers that use alternative locomotion strategies to traverse extreme lunar terrain. In September 2021, I assembled and recruited a team of 13 undegraduate students with a variety majors. Next, throughout the Fall semester we performed research and literature review into existing mobility solutions and extreme lunar terrain.
		First, we selected craters as the extreme lunar terrain to pursue over caves due to the confirmed prescence of water and NASA's desire to build a base camp in the lunar south pole. We identified three key mobility challenges associated with craters, high porosity regolith, steep crater slopes and lack of sunlight. This led us to search for locomotion methods that utilize little energy to traverse large distances and are robust against sinkage, such as tumbling and slithering. From here, we performed research into sidewinding, a specific slithering gait used by rattlesnakes to traverse sand, which is porous like lunar regolith. 
	    	Here is a video of our proposal - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VevbIF4p5l8. We were recently selected as 1 of 7 schools to receive funding and fully develop our mobility concept.

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In order to explore the permanently shadowed regions of the moon, our team devised a unique system architecture called SCOUT (Surveying Craft for Observing Unexplored Terrain) and DOGHOUSE (Deployable Out-of-crater Generator for Holding and Utilizing Solar Energy). 
	    Upon landing on the moon, SCOUT would carry DOGHOUSE and place it at the edge of the crater. While SCOUT goes into the crater to explore, DOGHOUSE would deploy a set of solar panels and charge a set of batteries. Once SCOUT's batteries are low, it would return to DOGHOUSE to charge via an inductive charging plate and then return to the PSR to keep exploring. 
        </p>
	    
	    <img src = "images/SCOUT_DOGHOUSE_adobespark.jpeg">
	<p>
	    Problem: How to design a compact solar power generation system that meets strict constraints on mass and volume? (30 x 25 x 50 cm)
		
	 </p>
	    
	  <p>
		
	  </p>
	    
	   <p>
		Solution: Based on preliminary calculations, we determined we would need ten 25 x 25 cm solar panels to meet power requirements. In order to comapctly stow these solar panels during transportation, we decided to fold the solar panels like an accordian and utilize a set of interlocking telescoping rods to keep the solar panels unfolded.
		
		     
	      </p>
	
		<img src = "images/folded_unfolded_doghouse_adobespark.jpeg">
		 <img src = "images/doghouse_diagram_adobespark.jpeg">
	    
	    <p>
		   
		I personally worked on the design and development of a mechanism to drive deployment of these solar panels from their folded to unfolded state. We decided to utilize a torque spring to drive deployment of these solar panels as opposed to a motor to reduce primarily mass and energy consumption and to increase reliability. We were inspired by the way in which a motorized car antenna is deployed. 
		In the end, this system contained three torque springs which could be wound up and when released, they turned a driving gear. This driving gear meshed with a flexible gear rack which was coiled inside of a compact housing. The flexible gear rack was fixed to the top of the telescoping rods and it would be driven upwards by driving gear, which would raise the telescoping rods and unfold the solar panels. 
		Additionally, I selected and incorporated a solenoid into the system to automatically release the torque springs. 
	    </p>
	    
	     <p>
		
	  </p>
	    
	     <img src = "images/deployment_diagram_adobespark.jpeg">
	   <p>
		Testing: This project required a lot of iterative design and testing. In addition to testing the torque spring mechanism many times, I also worked on designing and integrating it with the telescoping rods. 
		 After improving the design of the telescoping rods, I worked for a 2 week long period over Christmas break to achieve testing results for our presentation. In the end I was able to demonstrate our system deploying and locking to 80% of our desired height with a load of 1 kilogram (60% of our desired load). 
	   	This was achieved through printing parts on my own 3D printer and other miscellaneous hardware from hardware shops.

		Solution: The goal of the project was to incorporate tiny actuators onto Aerobat so that it's orientation and position could be controlled in flight. In a closed loop fashion, Aerobat could use these actuators to turn, land etc. and maintain stability despite disturbances. Therefore, the project began with research into actuation methods and control methods for aerial vehicles. I performed literature review of many different actuation methods ranging from piezoelectric mechanisms to shape memory alloys and electric motors. Working with Professor Ramezani, who leads the project, we decided to move forward with shape memory alloys for their low mass and ease of actuation. 
		I also helped brainstorm the different ways that we could control Aerobat's flight, such as wing feathering (changing the wing surface area), adjusting the camber of the wing and flexible flap and rudder-like features.
		Moving forward, the downside of shape memory alloys are their limited stroke length, which for shape memory wire is equal to 5% of the total length. This led to the next phase which required research on a variety of mechanical amplification methods. 
		I assisted the fabrication and test of some of these implementations, such as rhombus amplification structures and lever systems.

		After a few proof of concept tests, we decided that this type of actuation was not feasible for controlling Aerobat due to limited stroke length, heat generation and slow response time.

		  The next idea proposed by Professor Ramezani was to use thrust vectoring of propellers to control the flight of Aerobat. I helped design and develop living hinge mechanical amplifiers that leveraged the capabilities of a Markforged 3D printer. 
		    The Markforged printer uses a composite material called Onyx, which consists of carbon fiber filled nylon, which means even just a few layers are incredibly strong. Using this capability, we could print flexible structures and living hinges in the Z-direction on the printer quite easily. I developed these mechanisms from initial sketches to functional prototypes, through computer-aided design and testing. 
		    After multiple iterations of optimizing the living hinges and changing the mechanical advantage to increase the displacement of the propeller, we tested the mechanism on the Aerobat platform. This functional prototype consisted of living hinge mechanical amplifiers that utilized small servo motors to change the direction of the propeller. First we demonstrated that the mechanism could be used to control the pitch of Aerobat. After this was shown through multiple flight tests, we began to work on a system to control both pitch and yaw.

	    <p>
		  Initially, I tried to combine pitch and yaw control into one system, by having the yaw control mechanism placed on the pitch mechanism. However, this created a large lever arm for the pitch control servo, which led to poor response time and performance. 
		  Next we decided to separate the pitch and yaw control mechanisms, so we had pitch control propeller on the bottom of the tail and yaw control propeller on the top of the tail.

		  Throughout this time I helped perform many flight experiments where we would record Aerobat in slow motion and try to understand it's behavior. I also learned about the role of center of gravity and center of lift play in the dynamics of flight. I utilized this understanding to optimize the position of the pitch and yaw control mechanisms and to identify failure modes of the system.
