              <h3>NASA BIG Idea Challenge</h3>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Member of the Northeastern Team participating in the NASA BIG Idea Challenge. 
              The challenge was to develop a system that could be used in future missions to explore the permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of the moon.
            </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
             I worked on the Mechanical sub-team developing a module that would sit on the edge of the PSR to collect solar energy.
             The energy would be stored in batteries and used to charge an exploratory rover that would make repeated trips into the PSR to gather information and samples
             My specific task was to design a mechanism that could be used to deploy the solar panels from a small stowed state to a sufficient height dependent on the number of solar panels and energy generation.
             The specific requirements we developed were to deploy a solar panel mass of 1.5 kilograms from a stowed height of 0.15 meters to 1.5 meters, an expansion ratio of 10.
          </p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
        <!--<div class="image">

          <p>
            Through brainstorming as a team, we considered many different methods of deploying the solar panels ranging from mechanisms, like scissor lifts, to shape-memory composite materials. 
            Eventually, the car power antenna mechanism was brought up. This mechanism is used in all modern cars and involves a telescoping antenna that is driven by a motor and flexible gear rack.
            The flexible gear is coiled compactly inside of a housing and is driven by a gear which is turned by the motor. This mechanism was attractive because of it's large expansion ratio. 
            We decided to emulate this design and create a larger version of it for our solar panel deployment. We developed 3 modules from this design, the first was the telescoping rods which provided structure to the system once it was deployed. 
            Secondly, there were the solar panels, which also had to be folded and then easily unfolded as the telescoping rods were driven upwards. We decided on folding the solar panels like an accordion. The third module was the mechanism that would drive the antenna upwards, which I worked on with one other student.
            Initially, we considered using a motor to drive deployment, but decided to use a torque spring instead. The spring reduced the complexity of the system and reduced energy usage in the critical time before the solar panels are deployed.
            I performed hand calculations to determine the torque that the load would apply to the springs. After discussing the calculations, we researched and selected a spring with the correct torque and dimensions. 
            Next, the prototyping phase began, where I independently developed all CAD, designing components such as housing for the flexible gear rack and the torque springs and a base to connect it all. I also researched and purchased all materials for prototyping such as aluminum shafts, shaft coupler and more. 
            Before using a flexible gear rack we tried to push a plastic filament out of a cylindrical housing by pushing from the back. There was too much friction with the filament pressing against the sides. Then, we looked into the car power antenna mechanism and noticed how they used a driving gear and a flexible plastic gear rack.
            We then purchased our own flexible gear rack and designed a geared plastic housing for the springs. This way when the springs turned the gear would turn and the driving would mesh with the gear rack driving it upwards.
            After the switch to a gear and flexible gear rack we had much better transfer of force from the springs, however there was still too much friction and the flexible gear rack would get tangled inside of its housing. We then decided to design a guide inside of the flexible gear rack housing. This guide served as a track for the gear rack to lie on, it constrained its motion so that it would be driven out without jamming. 
            It also reduced the surface area of the gear rack that was in contact with the guide, reducing the friction. After testing we also decided to increase the number of torque springs to overcome the friction. Initially, we were only using one torque spring, but the final design used three torque springs.
